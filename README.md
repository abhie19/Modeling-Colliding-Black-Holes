# Modeling-Colliding-Black-Holes
Initial commit of all R code and data to GitHub repo

GOAL:
Our is goal is going to be to model the position/energy of the black hole as a function of time for a given set of black hole masses and kick velocities.

INTRODUCTION:

Recent numerical relativity simulations have shown that emissions of gravitational waves during the merger of two massive blackholes delivers a kick to the final supermassive black hole ((SMBH) , with a magnitude as large as 4000 km/s. Once this SMBH is created, such high magnitude of kick velocity displaces it from it’s original position in the star cluster. Depending on the initial kick velocity, the SMBH might leave the star cluster on an elliptical orbit or may get completely ejected from the cluster. In case where the SMBH doesn’t get ejected, it follows an elliptical orbit until it loses all its energy as a result of friction and interaction from other stars in the cluster. We studied the motion of these SMBHs ejected from galaxy cores by such kicks and the effects on the stellar distribution.
